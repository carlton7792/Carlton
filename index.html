<p> A debate is an organized argument or contest of ideas in which the participants discuss a topic from two opposing sides. Those who agree with this statement or idea are the "Pro" side.  Those who will not agree with this statement or idea are the "Con" side.  Each side will show in an organized and clever way why they believe to have the right answers.  They will use examples and evidence to support their ideas while working towards a conclusion.   </p>

<ul> Some examples of debate topics are
<li> Abortion </li>
<li> Animal Testing </li>
<li> Is water wet? (its not) </li>
</ul>

<h1> My opinions about debating </h1>
<p> Personally, I'm a very opinionated person. Debating allows two people to argue two sides, come to a point and communicate on a civil level. </p>
